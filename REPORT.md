## Q1

Q1 is divided into different sub-parts: WAV-related, UI-related and compressor-related.

## Compression ratio

While the compression ratios of LZW are better, it does not show the impact of having to pack the dictionary into the file.

_Create a map of my implementation (classes, modules). Describe the interface of all objects._

| Filename | Huffman | LZW  | LZW-based Huffman | Huffman-based LZW |
| -------- | ------- | ---- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
|          |         |      |                   |                   |
|          |         |      |                   |                   |
